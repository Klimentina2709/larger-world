# larger.world Hackathon

## Project Overview

In August 2024, our team of four participated in a 48-hour hackathon to develop a single-page application (SPA) focused on the concept of unlearning and promoting a sustainable, inclusive world. Built from scratch using React.js and guided by a Figma design, we prioritized simplicity and functionality to create a user-friendly interface.

Despite the time constraints, we implemented key features, collaborated effectively in a remote environment, and used Git and GitHub to streamline our workflow. This experience highlighted the power of teamwork and reinforced our ability to deliver a cohesive, minimalistic product under pressure.

## Key Features

- Implemented several static pages utilizing React.js and Material-UI, ensuring a aesthetically pleasing user experience.
- Developed horizontal scroll page.
- Created a seamless navigation experience across the application with optimized routing.

## Development Process

- **Collaboration:** Worked effectively with team members to divide tasks and leverage each other's strengths, ensuring that we met our project goals within the tight 48-hour timeframe.
- **Project Management:** Managed timelines and responsibilities, facilitating regular check-ins and updates to maintain project alignment and momentum.
- **Version Control:** Utilized Git and GitLab for version control, which streamlined our workflow, minimized conflicts, and ensured all team members were consistently aligned throughout the development process.

## Challenges Faced

- **Time Constraints:** Due to the 48-hour time limit, we faced challenges in structuring the full codebase and implementing additional features. As a result, we were unable to add more animations and pages than we had initially planned.
- **Complexity of Features:** Some features proved to be more complex than anticipated. We had to prioritize essential features over others to meet the deadline.
- **Coordination Among Team Members:** While collaboration was effective, ensuring constant alignment on tasks and progress required clear communication, especially as we juggled multiple responsibilities in a short timeframe.

## Lessons Learned

- Gained valuable experience in rapid development and teamwork in a high-pressure environment.
- Enhanced skills in version control and collaborative coding practices.
